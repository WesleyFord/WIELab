/*
===========
INFORMATION
===========

This controller is only written for rendering pages. Some pages need objects to display data.
These data need to be passed to the res.render() function. Here's an example for that:

    -res.render('userposts', {user: req.user, posts: req.user.posts})

    In this line of code, 'userposts' argument declares that userpost.ejs file will be used.
    Second object defines which objects will be used inside of userposts.ejs file. Now,
    you can access 'req.user' object as 'user' inside of the ejs file. Similar for the 
    posts. 'req' object is created by Express and it is passed while handling the request
    between middleware functions and it can be altered. 'user' object is added to 'req'
    object after authentication by Passport and 'posts' object is added after gathering
    posts from database by post.controller. If you need to add some other data then 
    these, you need to attach them into the 'req' object inside the controller.

I wrote some information about the needed objects but it may be not enough. For example,
if an user is logged in, username must be displayed in every page. That is why you
should always pass req.user object to render function. There may be another cases which
I did not cover, so please consider this.
